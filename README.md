# SharingStuff
For now, just sharing beginnings of a simple game written in Java and using libGDX.  
  
So far implemented tile map, character sprite, ASWD movement, hold left shift to run faster. simple f3 debug info.  
  
# Maps  
NOT infinite  
Left Up render order  
Layers: BaseBlocking, BaseWalkable, BaseForeground  
  
If you put a testmap.tmx file in the same folder as the jar file, it will load that map.  
*** You must edit your tmx file with notepad or something, and change the image path to be ../tilesets/basictiles.png (or things.png) or it will crash.
